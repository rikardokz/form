# Form Project
## Form using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS

This a project from brad traversy, and iÂ´ve made a point on doing first everything myself, step by step.
Some solutions i think are better and stayed in the project, others i've changed to brad's point of view.

## Functions in the validator:
Shows error / Sucess message.
Checks e-mail is a real e-mail address
Checks passwords match and informs on both outputs.
Checks if field is empty.
Checks the required length dynamically.
